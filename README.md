# Enrollment Web App

The Enrollment Web App is a project designed to provide a user-friendly platform for managing student enrollment in different courses. It is a web application that hosts three databases for students, courses, and instructors. With the enrollment web app, administrators can easily add, edit and delete data, such as student records, course schedules, and instructor details.

# Tools:
The project is built using a combination of several technologies such as HTML/CSS for the frontend, Python for the backend, and Bootstrap and Flask frameworks for the web application. The database management system used in the project is MySQL-Alchemy, which provides a flexible and reliable way to manage data.

# Project Structure:
The project structure consists of three main folders, which are static, templates, and app.py. The static folder contains all the Bootstrap files used in the project, while the templates folder contains all the HTML files used in the project. The HTML files include the index.html file for the body of the page, base.html, and header.html for the title and header of the page. The app.py file is the main Flask app that contains all the application and database logic.

# How to run the web app:
To run the enrollment web app, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo by downloading or using git clone command.
2. Make sure you have Python, Flask and other dependencies installed.
3. Open the cloned directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the app.py file using the command 'python App.py'.
